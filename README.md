Shiny app can be accessed here: https://gituser-11.shinyapps.io/pharma_app/

Open payments are payments made to HCPs by Pharma companies for various reasons such as consulting, educational lectures, speaker events, royalty etc. These can also be in the form of food, travel expenses, charity.

Here I analyzed the general payments made for the period of Aug-Dec'13. 2013 was the first time such favors were mandatory to be disclosed by the companies. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) runs this national disclosure program to ensure transparency and accountablity in the health care system.
